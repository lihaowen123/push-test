This is because the overhanging walls can adhere to a neighouring perimeter while printing. However; this option results in slightly reduced surface quality as the external perimeter is deformed by being squashed to the internal perimeter.;;Use Inner/Outer/Inner for the best external surface finish and dimensional accuracy as the external wall is printed undisturbed from an internal perimeter. However; overhang performance will reduce as there is no internal perimeter to print the external wall against. This option requires a minimum of 3 walls to be effective as it prints the internal walls from the 3rd perimeter onwards first; then the external perimeter and; finally; the first internal perimeter. This option is recomended against the Outer/Inner option in most cases. ;;Use Outer/Inner for the same external wall quality and dimensional accuracy benefits of Inner/Outer/Inner option.

Higher values mean higher extrusion rate changes are allowed; resulting in faster speed transitions.;;A value of 0 disables the feature. ;;For a high speed; high flow direct drive printer (like the Bambu lab or Voron) this value is usually not needed. However it can provide some marginal benefit in certain cases where feature speeds vary greatly. For example; when there are aggressive slowdowns due to overhangs. In these cases a high value of around 300-350mm3/s2 is recommended as this allows for just enough smoothing to assist pressure advance achieve a smoother flow transition.;;For slower printers without pressure advance; the value should be set much lower. A value of 10-15mm3/s2 is a good starting point for direct drive extruders and 5-10mm3/s2 for Bowden style. ;;This feature is known as Pressure Equalizer in Prusa slicer.;;Note: this parameter disables arc fitting.,Unchanged,
